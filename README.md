# Login-registration form Using MERN
I have build a complete login and registration functionality in Mern stack (ReactJs, NodeJs, ExpressJs, MongoDB) and also have dealt some concepts related to JavaScript and other function, like routing, spread Operator, etc.
The Login-Registration Form project involves building a user authentication system using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application allows users to register new accounts, log in with their credentials, and securely authenticate their identity.
